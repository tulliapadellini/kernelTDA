\title{Compute L_{2} Geodesic Laplacian Kernel (GLK)}
\usage{
lapl.kernel(d1, d2 = NULL, h, dimension, p)
}
\arguments{
\item{d1}{A persistence diagram (matrix with 3 col where the first one is the dimension, the second is the birth-time and the third is the death-time) or a list of diagrams}

\item{d2}{A persistence diagram (matrix with 3 col where the first one is the dimension, the second is the birth-time and the third is the death-time).}

\item{h}{bandwidth of the kernel}

\item{dimension}{The dimension of the topological feature (0 for connected components, 1 for cycles etc)}

\item{p}{order of the p-Wasserstein distance}
}
\value{
If \code{d1} is a list of Persistence Diagrams, this function returns a matrix whose (i,j) entry is the GLK computed in (\code{d1}[[i]], \code{d2}[[j]]),
otherwise it returns the value for the GLK computed in (\code{d1}, \code{d2}).
