# kernelTDA

This `R`-package provides an implementation of the most famous kernels found in the framework of Topological Data Analysis (TDA), more specifically:

* Persistence Scale Space Kernel
* Gaussian Kernel 
* Fisher Kernel 
* Geodesic Wasserstein Kernel(s)
* Persistence Images

While topological methods in data analysis have gained considerable attention in the last couple of years, their popularity is not matched in the practice of data analysis  In addition to method As opposed to their  `kernelTDA` The goal of kernelTDA is to 

## Installation

You can install the released version of kernelTDA from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("kernelTDA")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(kernelTDA)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
