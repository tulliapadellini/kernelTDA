Description: Provides tools for exploiting topological information into standard Statistical Learning algorithms. 
  To this aim, this package contains the most popular kernels defined on the space of Persistence Diagrams, and Persistence Images.
  Moreover, it provides a solver for kernel Support Vector Machines problems, whose kernels are not necessarily positive semidefinite, 
  based on the C++ library 'LIBSVM' <https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/>, and on its R implementation <e1071>.
  Additionally, it allows to compute Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams with an arbitrary ground metric, 
  building an R interface for the C++ library 'HERA' <https://bitbucket.org/grey_narn/hera/src/master/>.
